        <p>Today is February 16, 2023.</p>
        <p>This is the fourth day of the first week of our Kodego class.</p>
        <p>Due to work overlap, Sir Von gave us this task to make an html.</p>
        <p>We were instructed to add text color to the even-numbered paragraphs,</p>
        <p>while the first and last lines are to have background colors.</p>
        <p>It's interesting actually.</p>
        <p>This lesson only proves that there are multiple ways</p>
        <p>on how to make something look particluarly the same as desired.</p>
        <p>No matter what the process is,</p>
        <p>sometimes the end justifies the means.</p>
